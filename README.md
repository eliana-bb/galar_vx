# Sword and Shield: Collector's Edition

## What this mod is
The purpose of Collector's Edition (SwShCE) is to make every Pokémon available via a single copy of Pokémon Sword or Pokémon Shield. These include all the version exclusives, as well as all the Mythicals and other Pokémon that are usually event-only or transfer-only.
- This means a complete Living Pokédex, including every species and every form, is (read: *will be*) possible from a single save file.

## What this mod isn't
- This mod **does not add any Pokémon not transferrable from HOME.** It does not reverse Dexit. Check out the [Dexite Mod](https://gamebanana.com/mods/349303) by FlorianDX if you're looking for something like that.
  - For example, Rattata is not and has never been obtainable in Pokémon Sword and Shield. This mod does not bring it in.
- This mod is not a difficulty hack. Trainers are left completely unchanged.
  - The only significant difficulty change is that it's no longer possible to run straight to the Crown Tundra and sweep the game with a team of Lv. 70 legendaries.
 
# Features
## New Evolutions
Every Pokémon with a trade evolution or region-specific evolution has been given an alternate method! Documentation on the changed evolutions can be found [here] TODO. 

In general, Pokémon that evolve via a trade with a held item now simply need to hold that item and level up to evolve. Pokémon that evolve by trading without a held item can be evolved with the Linking Cord.

## New Items
### Evolution Stones

TODO Linking Cord: Pokémon that normally evolve through trades without a held item can have this used on them to evolve.

![Strange Souvenir](https://github.com/msikma/pokesprite/blob/master/items-outline/other-item/strange-souvenir.png?raw=true) Strange Souvenir: Pokémon that have an evolution specific to Alola (e.g. Pikachu -> Raichu-Alola) can be evolved with this item.

![S.S. Ticket](https://github.com/msikma/pokesprite/blob/master/items-outline/key-item/ss-ticket.png?raw=true) S.S. Ticket: Pokémon that have an evolution specific to Galar (e.g. Koffing -> Weezing-Galar) can be evolved into their original forms (e.g. Weezing-Kanto) with this item.

 ### Summoning Items
 This patch also adds twenty-two ★Summoning Items, used to call legendary Pokémon to the Watchtower. These allow for the encountering of otherwise version-exclusive legendaries.
